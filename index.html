    <h1>We ain't worried, We give no fucks, We Embrace It - LK12 aka Alexander McKinney (Founder/Owner) of Darkbin & (Founder/Leader) of the LK LLC</h1>
    <h4>darkbin does <u>not</u> exist anymore and all members are gone. Anybody claiming to be darkbin or 'in' darkbin are fake/impersonators and losers.</h4>
    <h4>Anyone claiming to be one of our members or affiliated with us is lying. We have all moved on to different things and are no longer involved with this, Darkbin and things that were going on, etc. So please, stop being losers, thanks.</h4>
    <h4>LK12 and LK47 both went MIA and disappeared. Have moved on to different things and no longer involved with this, Darkbin and things that went on inside of Darkbin and the LK LLC, etc.</h4>
